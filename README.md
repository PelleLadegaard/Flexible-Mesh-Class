# Flexible-Model-Class

This class gives you the flexibility to store "arrays" of data groups with any combination of data types without having to create unique classes for every data type combination. As an additional bonus, all data is stored in a sequential buffer.

The class was originally written to store model data for rendering purposes, but it can be implemented for many other systems as well.
